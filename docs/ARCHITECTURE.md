# Architecture

## Long-term direction

- **Backend**: Python, FastAPI, SQLAlchemy 2.x, Alembic, PostgreSQL
- **Solver**: Google OR-Tools CP-SAT
- **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, Vite
- **Shape**: modular monolith, with scheduling/domain logic isolated from
  API/UI/infrastructure. The solver must be independently executable and
  testable without any of the above.

## Current milestone

Only the solver core exists today, as a standalone Python package with no
web framework, database, or UI. It is organized so the eventual FastAPI
layer can sit on top of it without touching solver internals.

```
src/school_timetable/
├── domain/         Pure Python domain model. No OR-Tools, no I/O.
├── validation/      Preflight validation (runs before CP-SAT).
├── scheduling/       CP-SAT model building, solving, weights, result conversion.
├── verification/     Independent post-hoc verifier (does not trust CP-SAT).
└── fixtures/         Deterministic synthetic test fixtures.
```

## Module boundaries

- **domain/**: typed dataclasses/enums describing the scheduling problem
  and its result. Nothing here imports `ortools`. This is the shared
  vocabulary for validation, solving, and verification.
- **validation/**: `run_preflight(problem) -> list[ValidationError]`.
  Reasons purely about domain objects; never inspects a CP-SAT model.
- **scheduling/**: the only package allowed to import `ortools`.
  - `model_builder.py` turns a `SchedulingProblem` into CP-SAT
    variables/constraints/objective (a `BuiltModel`).
  - `weights.py` centralizes soft-constraint penalty weights.
  - `result_builder.py` converts a solved model back into domain
    `ScheduleEntry` objects.
  - `solver.py` is the public `solve(problem) -> SchedulingResult`
    entry point, orchestrating preflight -> build -> solve -> convert.
- **verification/**: `verify(problem, entries) -> VerificationReport`,
  re-derived from scratch by scanning the final schedule -- it never reads
  CP-SAT variables or trusts the solver's own claim of feasibility.
- **fixtures/**: synthetic, deterministic problem builders used by tests
  and manual runs. No real school data.

## Why isolate the solver like this

A schedule that violates a hard constraint is a bug, not a partial
success. Keeping preflight, model-building, and verification as separate,
independently testable modules means a bug in one layer cannot silently
paper over a bug in another -- in particular, the independent verifier is
the safety net if the CP-SAT encoding itself has a modeling defect (this
happened once during this milestone's development; see `PROJECT_STATE.md`).

## What does not exist yet

No FastAPI app, no persistence layer, no REST endpoints, no frontend, no
auth, no Docker. These are deliberately out of scope for this milestone
per `DECISIONS.md`.
